/ Artist Page

/ Album Page

 

EXTRA FEATURES:

/ When clicking on a song, display the title, the artist and the album picture in the bottom left area

/ Show comments using the usual API (use album id!)

 

For the Home page, use
https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/deezer/search?q=whatever
to get some albums.

For the Album Page, use the
/albums/:id
https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/deezer/album/{id} API.
You can get the album ID from the search API es.: json.data[0].album.id 
      
For the Artist page, use the
/artist/:id
https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/deezer/artist/{id} API
You can get the artist ID from the search API es.: json.data[0].artist.id
 

Hints
* Use react-router-dom to implement navigation (Router, Route, Link...)
* Create a component for the "Song" that you can reuse everywhere in the App
* You can easily rework your HTML code for the navbar and the media player and create react components out of it
* Make navbar and footer (media player) available in every page by not routing them
